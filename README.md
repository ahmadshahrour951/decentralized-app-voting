# Voting Dapp!

I will be creating a DApp for voting where all of the votes and candidate registration happens on chain.
- It will allow anyone to start an election with a registration period, voting period, and ending time.
- It will allow anyone to sign up as a candidate during the registration period.
- It will allow anyone to vote once during the voting period.

A frontend will also be made where voters can see the results and know how long is left in the election. As for the framework I'll be using Truffle.
